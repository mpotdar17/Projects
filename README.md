## Walmart Project. Using Kaggle's dataset for Walmart, I have answered below questions:
Does external temperature affect Sales at Walmart?
Using the sample at hand, can we say that overall sales at Walmart have changed over the years - 2010, 2011, and 2012?
Can we segment all weeks in a year into distinct groups based on their aggregate sales? This information can be used to design similar promotional campaigns within each segment.
